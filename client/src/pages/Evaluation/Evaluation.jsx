          The approval of a proposal involves evaluating its feasibility,
          originality, relevance, innovation and potential impact across
          multiple disciplines, the potential academic impact (publications) and
          its practical impact.
          <br />
          <br />
          The various criteria will have a different weight in the final grading
          of the proposal. A minimum grade is required for a proposal to be
          accepted. All issues mentioned must be addressed in the proposal.
