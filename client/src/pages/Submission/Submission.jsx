      <h1>Guidelines</h1>
      <p>
        Submissions of proposals will be done online, on the ACT online
        platform, according to the Submission specifications (see Appendix 1).
        The maximum duration of a project can be two years.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A plan of the project must be submitted identifying the project
        objectives/targets on the basis of half-year intervals (interim progress
        reports). The deliverables will be reviewed every six months on the
        basis of the project objectives/targets for the period in question. A
        progress report will be submitted by the research team on a bi-yearly
        basis and meeting the objectives/targets will be the criterion for the
        financing of the following project face. The proposals submitted will be
        reviewed and evaluated by the ACT Center.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The interim and final evaluations will be done by the Centerâ€™s
        management based on a clear and transparent evaluation method (See
        Appendix 2). In case a project falls outside the knowledge domains of
        the management, an ad-hoc scientific committee will be put together to
        evaluate the project.
